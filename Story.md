Once upon a time there was brave tailor .He went to sell his handmade caps to a village. After selling few caps he slept near one big banyan tree. When he woke up he saw that all caps were missing. He was searching here and there .When he went near one lake.He saw that group of monkey were sitting there wearing his handmade cap. He got too angry on them .He shouted them all and told "give me my caps".The monkeys were not at all responding. When he gave up and sat down they also sat .So he got one idea .He acted like removing his cap. They also did the same he took all caps and continued his day.
